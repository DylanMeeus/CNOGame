**** IT'S ALIVE! ****
As of today, 29/04/2014, I ran the first optimized build of this game on a low-end device (Nokia Lumia 520).
It ran charmingly smooth, the events launched correctly and I could play the game as it is supposed to be played.
Some minor issues to be fixed though - mostly related to scaling
**** IT'S ALIVE   ****


A repo for my CodenameOne game

This game is written entirely using CodenameOne, and was at first a game written in C# optimized for Windows Phone.
So far, the game is playable under Windows Phone devices, but remains untested under others. 

You are free to use this code for anything you want. Same goes for the images (which can be found in theme.res)
Though, a mention of the original code by me would be nice! :)
