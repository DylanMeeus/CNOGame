A repo for my CodenameOne game

This game is written entirely using CodenameOne, and was at first a game written in C# optimized for Windows Phone.
So far, the game is playable under Windows Phone devices, but remains untested under others. 

You are free to use this code for any purpose you feel necessary. Just as the images.


Update 18/04/2014:

- Optimized modularity
- Optimized performance
- Improved on MVC 
- Added EndWindow
- Added AboutWindow
- Added support for multiple display sizes.
- Fixed crash issues after finishing game
